Upon launching Eagle, you’ll see the Control Panel. 
Go to File > Open > Scripts > and select eagle.scr. Add the following line to the MENU area in both the BRD and SCH sections: 
'[bin/snapeda.png] SnapEDA : Run snapeda.ulp;'\

Move both "snapeda.ulp" and "json.inc" into the "ulp" folder in the Eagle application directory. 

In the bin folder, add the "snapeda.png" icon from Downloaded folder.

The SnapEDA plugin is now installed. When you start a new Schematic or Board, you should be able to see the SnapEDA icon in the top menu bar.
